# Dominance Analysis
## A Stata Implementaion

Dominance analysis (DA) determines the relative importance of independent variables in an 
estimation model based on contribution to an overall model fit statistic (see Gr√∂mping, 2007 
for a discussion).  DA is an ensemble method in which importance determinations about independent 
variables are made by aggregating fit metrics across multiple models, though the method usually 
requires the ensemble contain each possible combination of the independent variables in the 
full model.

The all possible combinations ensemble with _p_ independent variables in the full model results 
in 2^p-1^ models and fit statistics estimated.  That is, each combiation of _p_ variables 
alterating between included versus excluded (i.e., the 2 base to the exponent) where the 
constant(s)-only model is omitted (i.e., the -1 representing the distinct combination where 
no independent variables are included; see Budescu, 1993).

`domin` is implemented as a flexible wrapper command that can be used with most Stata estimation 
commands that follow the standard `depvar indepvars` format and return a scalar-valued fit 
statistic; commands that do not either follow this format or do not return a scalar-valued fit 
ststistic can be accommodated with a sub-wrapper command (an example of such a command is 
included below).

Some examples of the command as applied to Stata estimation commands are shown below after the 
discussion of installation.

# Installation and Updates
## Installing

To install `domin` type:

`ssc install domin` 

In the Stata Command console window.  `domin` is supported from Stata version `12.1`.

Note that `domin` requires the SSC package `moremata` and will ask to install this package if it 
is not available.

## Updating

To update `domin` once installed type:

`adoupdate domin, update`

In the Stata Command console window.

# Extensive Introductory Example

The example below focuses on a simpler predictive model but discusses conceptual elements of 
DA more extensively.

## Simple Linear Regression-based DA

The default analysis for `domin` is `regress` with `fitstat(e(r2))` and these options do not 
need to be typed (though if they are not, `domin` will throw a warning; see below). 
The results of the analysis are shown as below including general, conditional, and complete 
dominance results as well as the strongest dominance designations.

General dominance statistics are the most commonly reported and easiest to interpret of the 
dominance statistics. 
General dominance statistics are derived as the weighted average marginal/incremental 
contribution to the overall fit statistic an independent variable makes across all models in 
which the independent variable is included. 
For example, _rep78_ has a value of **0.0218** which means, on average, _rep78_ results in an 
increment to the R square of about two percentage points when it is included in the model.

In addition, the general dominance statistics can be compared to one another to determine which 
variables "generally dominate" others. Here, _rep78_'s larger general dominance statistic than 
_headroom_ indicates that it "generally dominates"--and is thus more important than--_headroom_. 
The only time a general dominance designation cannot be made between two independent variables 
is when they are exactly equal. 

General dominance statistics are useful in that they distill the entire ensemble of models 
estimated into a single value for each independent variable, which is why they are 
easiest to interpret. 
An additional useful property of the general dominance statistics is that they are 
an additive decomposition of the fit statistic associated with the full model 
(i.e., the general dominance statistics can be summed 
to obtain the value of the full model's fit statistic) and equivalent to Shapley 
values (see `findit shapley`). 

Finally, general dominance statistics for an independent variable are the arithmetic average 
of that independent variable's conditional dominance statistics discussed next.

### Conditional Dominance Statistics

```
Conditional dominance statistics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           #indepvars:  #indepvars:  #indepvars:
                    1            2            3
     mpg       0.2079       0.2262       0.2445
   rep78       0.0000       0.0218       0.0436
headroom       0.0124       0.0094       0.0065
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-more-
```
Conditional dominance statistics are computed as the average incremental contributions to the 
overall model fit statistic an independent variable makes within a single "order" of 
models--where "order" refers to a distinct number of independent variables in the estimation 
model. 
In the example above, order one is `#indepvars:1` and refers to the incremental contribution 
the independent variable makes by itself. 
Order two is `#indepvars:2` and refers to the average incremental contribution the independent 
variable makes beyond a single other independent variable. 
Finally, order three is `#indepvars:3` and refers to the incremental contribution the 
independent variable makes beyond the other two independent variables.

Each independent variable will have `p` different conditional dominance statistics. 

Conditional dominance statistics, considered as a set, provide more information about 
each independent variable than general dominance statistics. 
Specifically, conditional dominance statistics show the effect of variable redundancy, 
collinearity, and suppression effects as the user can see how the inclusion of any independent 
variable is, on average, affected by the inclusion of other independent variables. 
In the above conditional dominance matrix, observe the difference between the patterns of 
results for _rep78_ and _headroom_. 
_rep78_ shows suppression-like effects in that it grows in predictive usefulness with 
more independent variables included in the model.
By contrast, _headroom_ shows the opposite pattern shrinking in importance with more included 
independent variables.

As with general dominance statistics, conditional dominance statistics can be compared to 
determine which "conditionally dominance" others.
Consider _mpg_. It has larger conditional dominance statistics than independent variable _rep78_ 
across all three orders and thus "conditionally dominates" _rep78_. 
Conditional dominance is then determined for an independent variable over another
when its conditional dominance statistics at each order are larger than another the other 
independent variable's statistics across all `p` orders. 
If, at any order, the conditional dominance statistics for two independent variables are equal 
or there is a change rank order no conditional dominance designation can be made between those 
independent variables. 
Because it involves comparing more statistics to one another, conditional domiance is a 
more stringent importance criterion than general dominance.

Conditional dominance imples general dominance as well, but the reverse is not true. 
An independent variable can generally dominate another, but not conditionally dominate it. 
For instance, _rep78_ generally dominates, but does not conditionally dominate, _headroom_.

### Complete Dominance Designations
```
Complete dominance designation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      dominated?:  dominated?:  dominated?:
                             mpg        rep78     headroom
     dominates?:mpg            0            1            1
   dominates?:rep78           -1            0            0
dominates?:headroom           -1            0            0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-more-
```
Complete dominance designations are made by comparing all possible incremental contributions 
to model fit for two independent variables. 
Complete dominance is the strongest evidence of importance across dominance designations as it 
is the most stringent comparision, requiring that an independent variable **always** have a 
larger increment to model fit across all,  2^(p-2)^ comparable individual models in the ensemble. 
This metric is stringent as it is non-compensatory; it is not possible for some better
incremental contributions to compensate for other, worse ones. 

By comparison to general and conditional dominance designations, the complete dominance 
designation has no natural statistic onn which to report.
That said, `domin` returns a complete dominance matrix which reads from the left to right. 
Thus, a value of **1** means that the indepdendent variable in the row completely 
dominates the independent variable in the column. 
Conversely, a value of **-1** means the opposite, that the independent variable in 
the row is completely dominated by the independent variable in the column. 
A **0** value means no complete dominance designation could be made as the comparison 
independent variables' incremental contributions differ in relative magnitude from model to model.

the example above shows that, _mpg_ has a larger incremental contribution to 
model fit than _headroom_ across all comparable models and completely dominates it. 
By contrast, _headroom_ and _rep78_ show a more complex relationship (as was seen in 
their conditional dominance statistics) and no conditional dominance designation can be made.
Complete dominance imples both general and conditional dominance, but, again, the 
reverse is not true. Failure to obtain conditional dominance also implies failure to obtain 
complete dominance.

### Strongest Dominance Designtions

```
Strongest dominance designations

mpg completely dominates rep78
mpg completely dominates headroom
rep78 generally dominates headroom
```
Finally, if all three dominance statistics are reported (i.e., `noconditional` and `nocomplete` 
options are not used), a _strongest dominance designations_ list is reported.  The strongest 
dominance designations list reports the strongest dominance designation between all pairwise, 
independent variable comparisons.

Variables included in all subsets: turn
```

As compared to the `regress`-based DA reported in the first example, this example includes a 
covariate that is controlled for across all model subsets. 

The `All Subsets Fit Stat.     =                  0.1003` result represents the amount 
of the McFadden pseudo-R-square that is associated with the variable in all subsets 
(i.e., in `all()`). 

Note that the dominance statistics reported are now residualized and reflect the removal of 
the all fitstats fit statistic. 
Variables included in all subsets are also reported at the end of the results display 
(e.g., `Variables included in all subsets: turn`).

## Logistic Regression-based DA

`logit` is another command that can be accommodated in `domin`.  In this example, _rep78_ is 
used as a factor variable.

```

Strongest dominance designations

Variables in set1: i.rep78
```

The `sets()` option incorporates independent variables as inseparable sets that are considered 
*an* independent variable in the DA. 
The label for each set is denoted sequentially as they are included (e.g., _set1_). 
In addition, variables in sets are included near the end of the output 
(i.e., `Variables in set1: i.rep78`). 

# Intermediate Examples

These examples outline more complex applications of DA to Stata models.

## Linear Regression-based DA with Non-additive and Non-linear Effects

The example below outlines a process in which two quadratic effects and a product are 
residualized and used as independent variables in a linear regression-based DA to determine 
their importance.

The process involves residualizing the squared and product terms and using them, as is, in the
DA.

Strongest dominance designations

mpg completely dominates headroom
mpg2r completely dominates headroom
headr2r completely dominates headroom
mpg completely dominates mpg2r
mpg completely dominates headr2r
mpg2r completely dominates headr2r
mpg completely dominates mpg_headrr
mpg2r completely dominates mpg_headrr
headr2r completely dominates mpg_headrr
headroom generally dominates mpg_headrr
```

In this case, the squared term for _mpg_ (i.e., _mpg2r_) was actually more important than most 
other terms in the model. 
This approach is based on the article by LeBreton, Tonidandel, and Krasikova (2013).

## Linear Regression-based Relative Weights Analysis with Bootstrapped Standard Errors

`domin` can also estimate relative weights analysis (RWA) using the `epsilon` option. 
RWA is a faster, approximation to DA and obviates the each subset regression by orthogonalizing 
independent variables using singular value decomposition (see `matrix svd`). 

`epsilon`'s singular value decomposition approach is not equivalent to the all 
possible combinations ensemble approach of DA but is many fold faster for models with many 
independent variables and tends to produce similar answers regarding relative importance. 

DA and RWA can also be `boostrap`-ped to obtain stadard errors and evaluate statistic 
sampling stability if desired.

## Multivariate Linear Regression-based DA

`domin` comes packaged with a sub-wrapper program `mvdom` that allows for estimating DA 
statistics with multiple dependent variables.

The model reflected in the `mvdom`-based DA below is:

`mvreg price gear_ratio foreign length weight = mpg headroom trunk turn`

```
. domin price mpg headroom trunk turn, reg(mvdom, dvs(gear_ratio foreign length weight)) fitstat(e(r2))

The dominance statistics above account for multiple dependent variables and are based on the 
approach described by Azen and Budescu (2006).

## Gamma regression-based DA

`domin` allows for any scalar valued fit metric to br used as a DA-able metric and 
thus statistics such as model deviance can be used.

The example below uses a `glm` model with a gamma distribution.

Important notes about this model is that a `consmodel` is estimated (e.g., 
`Constant-only Fit Stat.   =                 11.6141`). 
Like entries in the `all()` model, this value is subtracted from the DA statistics. 

The `consmodel` differs from `all()` in that applies only to the estimation and removal of model 
_cons_-tants/intercepts; this is useful when the constant-only model is non-zero.
This DA also `reverse`s the interpretation of the fit metrics such that smaller values 
represent more important independent variables (i.e., larger negative values).

## Linear Mixed-effects Regression-based DA

`domin` also comes packaged with a sub-wrapper program `mixdom` that allows for estimating 
DA statistics with linear mixed effects models.

There can only be two levels of clustering/nesting in the data.  The analysis below uses 
the within-cluster r-square and the underlying model would be represented by:

`mixed ln_wage tenure hours age collgrad || id:`

# Advanced Examples

The examples here outline some of the most advanced features of `domin`

## Multinomial Logistic Regression-based DA
### Custom Program Generation using BIC as Fit Statistic

`domin` can be adapted to dominance analyze any user-generated model--so long as they adhere 
to a specific structure `domin` expects.

Specifically, the program must `ereturn scalar` or `return scalar` the fit statistic and the 
program's `syntax` must follow `syntax varlist if , [option]`. 

In the example below, a custom program _myprog_ is defined to obtain the Bayesian Information 
Criterion following a `mlogit` for DA purposes.

```
.     program define myprog, eclass
  1. 
.     syntax varlist if , [option]
  2. 
.     tempname estlist
  3. 
.     mlogit `varlist' `if'
  4. 
.     estat ic
  5. 
.     matrix `estlist' = r(S)
  6. 
.     ereturn scalar bic = `estlist'[1,6]
  7. 
.     end

## Logistic Regression-based DA: Revisited
### Multiply Imputed Estimates

`domin` can also accommodate multiply imputed data by including the `mi` option with 
multiply imputed data. 
By default, all imputations are used but options can be passed to `mi estimate` using 
`domin`'s `miopts()` option.

`domin` has been tested on `mi set` data styles of `wide`, `long`, and `flong`.
